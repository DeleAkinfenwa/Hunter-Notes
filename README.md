# Project Overview

## **Project Name**

Hunter Notes

## **Project Description**

I'm making an application for the game "Monster Hunter World" that will allow you to search a specific monster and display information regarding it such as location, weaknesses, and rewards for hunting it.

Here are some websites with a similar concept:
- https://scryfall.com (Magic the Gathering)
- https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page (Pokemon)

## **API and Data Sample**

API: https://mhw-db.com/

![API Sample](/Project_Imgs/APIsample.png)


## **Wireframes**

This is the wire frame for a desktop version. It'll feature a search bar/dropdown bar that will list all the monsters in the game. Each section will display a portion of the data about that specific monster

The mobile verison will have a very similar look but the lay out will have each information section stacked in order to keep the contents readable and properly formated
